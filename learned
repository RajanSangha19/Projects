This is a page where I can take notes on the code that I am learning outside of the freecodecamp courses in my other repository.

How to read and open files --> 
1) First you must open the file. The file must be in the same directory as the code
2) Then you must state what file you want to open and how you want to open it : file = open("file.txt", "r"), "r" means read mode and "file" is the name of the file
3) Now that file has the information, we can get this information by using this line of code: file.readline().strip("\n")      This reads the first line of the file (line by line).
   The .stip("\n") removes the newline character at the end of the line.
