First a word must be inputed
This can be extracted from a different file with a list of words
Next, the algorithm must output a series of underscores to show how long the missing word (the word "happy" would become "_ _ _ _ _")
The player must then guess the letters of the word
If they guess correct, the missing letter replaces the underscore
Else a life is taken away
If the same word has been inputed more than once, a life is lost
After all lives are gone or all letters have been reveiled, the game stops
