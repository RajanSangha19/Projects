This is the finished version of my local weather station project.

I am getting the data for the temperature, the percentage chance of rain and the wind speed in m/s from OpenWeather's API (as mentioned in the basic version).

This is running on a Raspberry Pi 3B which acts like a mini computer.

The screen displaying the information is the Waveshare E ink screen 7.5 inch model. 
When making this project it was important to read how to setup the libraries for this screen and to make sure that you are refrencing the correct screen in the code. 

To finish things off, I got a picture frame from Amazon, to make it look like the screen was just a piece of paper.

This project can be also be done with a smaller screen and a slower (but cheaper) raspberry pi to save on costs.
