For my second project I want to know what the temperature is in my local area
However I would also like more funtional features like the temperature, rain percentage and wind speed for the next couple of hours
To do this I would have to use an API from Openweather
They offer a free API called one call API 3.0 which gives enough API requests for my project
I will gather the data and print it for now
In an improved version I can figure a better way to display the information
