The car I am using is an old Tamiya RC from around 20 years ago.

It is around 1/14th size and it was designed to be for off-road use.

There are a lot of broken parts and the car is in pieces. As of starting this project, the car is not functional.

The car has a 7.2V battery and a tamiya tuned sport brushed motor that can put out 18,300 rpm
