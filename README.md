# Projects
This is where I can use my skills to create projects

There are smaller projects that can be found in the "Smaller Projects" folder.

1st major project = **Local weather station** - using APIs / Local weather station advanced - Using APIs and using a raspberry pi and an e ink screen.
The code acts as a template allowing you to create your own weather station
