**Disassembly**

First I removed all the electronics and the main body.

Not everthing needs to be replaced. The servos will try to be saved (but there is some damage to the wires) and the front and rear of the car will be useful as the suspension, steering and gears just need some maintenance.

Next I had to disassemble the main body. If I wanted space for new and more electronics, I was going to have to create a new main body. After removing some screws, I was left with this, a detached body ready for a new one.

In the future I may change the wheels as the off-road wheels are not desgined for speed, however for now they will do.
